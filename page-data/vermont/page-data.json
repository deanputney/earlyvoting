The election officials also check the certificate on the envelope containing the ballots to make sure it is properly filled out. When the election officials are satisfied that the early or absentee voter is legally qualified to vote, has not already voted in person and that the certificate is properly filled out, they open the envelope containing the ballot(s). Without unfolding the ballots or permitting the ballot to be seen, the election officials mark the entrance checklist indicating the fact that that voter has voted by means of an early voter absentee ballot, and then they deposit the ballots in the ballot boxes or voting machine. Early voter absentee ballots are commingled with the ballots of voters who have voted in person.  \n\n* See the [full voting information on Vermont's election website](https://sos.vermont.gov/elections/voters/early-absentee-voting/)","earlyVotingByMailInfoCombined":null,"sosElectionWebsite":"http://www.sec.state.vt.us/elections.aspx"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"vermont"}}}
