Anyone may vote using the early and in-person absentee voting options.\r\n\r\nAt the time you vote, your eligibility to vote in that election is verified by the absentee voting official. The official will look up your name in the voter registration database and will verify that your registration is active and current. If your registration is active and current, the official will print off a voter certificate with your information that you will sign. You will then be given a ballot to vote that is dropped into a ballot box after voting.\r\n\r\nEarly voting is only available at certain absentee voting locations that the division can establish a secure connection with the voter registration database system.
